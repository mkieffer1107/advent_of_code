    This quick approach uses LCMs to identify cycles.

    We can do this because xxZ maps you to the same position as the 
    starting xxA for a particular path. This means that the number of steps
    from xxA to xxZ is the same as going from xxZ back to xxZ again.

         0       1      ...      N
        xxA --> xxx --> ... --> xxZ
        xxZ --> xxx --> ... --> xxZ

    So we have a bunch of cycles that each have a constant number of steps.
    The LCM of all of these cycle steps is the minimum number of steps required 
    such that all paths simultaneously reach the end at xxZ.

    This is because finding the LCM of the number of steps for each path gives the
    smallest number of steps that they can all multiply to. The multiplier for each
    of these step numbers would then be the number of times required to repeat the particular 
    path such that it reaches xxZ at the same time as all the other paths. So
