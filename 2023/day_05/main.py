    The input seeds' intervals and their subsequent transformations / mappings do not overlap. I initially tried
    to just map the start and end numbers for each interval, but found that this did not work because it did not
    account for the mapping of numbers within the interval, i.e., [start, inside1, inside2, ..., end). 

    The key is to remap / split intervals after each transformation if there is an intersection. 

    We are given a source interval S = [s1, s2), a mapping interval M = [m1, m2) (the range of numbers that are mapped 
    to some destination), and a map (maps intervals in the mapping interval to some destination interval D = [d1, d2))

        - if the source interval is outside of the mapping interval, then it maps to itself: 
                    
                    S !c M, so S -> S

        - if the source interval lies entirely inside the mapping interval, then it is shifted via the map by an offset:
            - but only the start and end of each interval is given (source S, mapping M, destination D), so to find 
              out how far from the start of the destination interval D[0] the source interval S should be mapped, we 
              must find its offset from the mapping interval M

                    a = S[0] - M[0] = s1 - m1                    (a is offset -- we assume s1 > m1 because S c M)
                    S c M, so map[S]-> [d1 + a, d2 + a) = D + a  (destination interval plus an offset)
                    
        - if part of the source interval lies within the mapping interval, and part of it lies outside of it, we
          must first split the source interval into the intesection of S and M, and to the difference of S and M 

                    some of S c M and some of S !c M

                    i = (S âˆ© M) c M   (intersection)
                    b = (S - M) !c M  (difference)

         now we can map the intersection and difference separately

                    i c M, so map[i] -> D + a    (where a is offset)

                    b !c M, so b -> b
    
    This process is repeated for each map. After the final transformation, the lowest interval value is the smallest final 
    possible output, so it is the answer!
